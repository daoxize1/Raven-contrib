"""Atomic operations for EverOS memory settings (``<root>/everos.toml``).

This module is the ONLY write path for the EverOS memory-model sections
(llm / embedding / rerank / multimodal) and for the ``[api]`` address. The
onboard wizard's memory step writes here; EverOS reads it back through its own
pydantic-settings loader (user-level toml, ``EVEROS_*`` env). It lives apart
from raven's ``config.json`` because EverOS owns this channel.

Only those sections are writable; the rest EverOS ships (memory / sqlite /
lancedb) are preserved untouched on every write.

**Which root.** EverOS resolves its root from ``EVEROS_ROOT`` (default: a bare
``~/.everos``). raven does not read that variable as an input — it *writes* it
from the root recorded in ``plugins.config["everos-memory"]["root"]``, so the
choice of root is an explicit, recorded decision rather than something inherited
from an ambient environment. A root picked up from the environment and never
written down was silent data loss waiting to happen: run raven without the
variable and the memories are still on disk while raven reports none.

**Which owner.** ``plugins.config["everos-memory"]["owned"]`` says whether raven
may write to that root at all. A root raven created is raven's to configure and
serve; a root the user manages is read-only — raven records its address and
nothing else.

Boot sequence (called by ``make_backend`` / ``make_understand_media_tool``):

1. :func:`configure_everos_env` — ``EVEROS_ROOT`` → the recorded root
2. :func:`ensure_everos_home` — create ``everos.toml`` + ``ome.toml`` from
   shipped templates (skip if exists) + migrate legacy ``config.toml``.
   Owned roots only.
