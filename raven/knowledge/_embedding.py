"""Where a knowledge base gets its vectors.

The endpoint is the one the operator already configured for EverOS memory
(``~/.everos/raven/everos.toml``, ``[embedding]``): an OpenAI-compatible base
URL, a key and a model. Reusing it means a knowledge base needs no second
credential and no picker fed from a provider catalogue.

Reading that file is *not* the same as depending on the EverOS service. Only
the three strings are taken; the request goes straight to the embedding
endpoint. The service is a separate process and has spent whole days
unresponsive, and a knowledge base must not be able to fail for that reason.
