"""Console handlers: ext.list / cron.* / settings.* / channels.status / fs.*.

The management surface a front end needs beside the transcript -- what is
installed, what is scheduled, what is configured, which channels are up, and
what is in the workspace. Nothing here is specific to one client.

Every handler reads and writes the same sources the CLI does (the CronService
