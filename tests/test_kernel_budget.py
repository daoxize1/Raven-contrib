"""The kernel's size budget, pinned to the numbers the L0 booklet froze.

raven/spine is the frozen kernel. Frozen means the promise is not broken while
the implementation may change, and additions are safe -- but only inside a
budget, or "frozen" stops meaning anything as the tree around it grows. The L0
booklet ruled four clauses and measured each true by hand on the two trees it
compared (1,347 and 1,355 lines; this branch measured 1,360 when the guard
landed):

1. the package holds at most LINE_CEILING lines of Python;
2. it imports no other raven package -- every import is its own, the stdlib,
   or an allowed third-party name, in-function imports included;
3. the third-party names are limited to THIRD_PARTY_ALLOWED (tiktoken lives in
   utils, not here);
4. no file carries a TODO, FIXME or HACK marker.

The two numbers were set tight on purpose. Loose (5,000 lines, four third-party
packages) would let the kernel grow to three and a half times its size before
anything went red, which three years on is no guard at all; tight means adding
anything to the kernel passes one explicit review. The booklet also names the
signal that a threshold was set wrong: loose, and the assertion never once
fails; tight, and someone starts bumping the number in passing -- the moment
that happens the guard has lost its authority. So a change to a constant below
is a reviewed change to this file, never a drive-by, and this docstring is
where the reviewer reads why the number is what it is.

Clause 2 overlaps `the kernel stands alone` (import-linter) and
tests/test_kernel_closure.py, which ask about the whole kernel set; this file
asks the narrower question the booklet asked, of spine alone.

One addendum (2026-08-31) extends clause 1's discipline to raven/contracts:
the papers are additions-safe by design, but additions inside a budget --
1,922 lines when the ceiling landed -- so a new paper passes the same
explicit review a kernel line does, in the same file the reviewer already
reads for why the numbers are what they are.

The contracts ceiling moved once, 2,500 -> 2,520 (2026-09-09), and this is
the review. The 578 lines of headroom it landed with were spent, and the
change that found the end of them adds exactly one line to the papers: an
``answered`` flag on ``ApprovalOutcome``, so that a permission request nobody
saw stops being reported to a model as one a human refused. Its prose fits
the docstring that was already there, so the field is the whole cost.

Twenty rather than one. A ceiling a single line under the count is a ceiling
that fails on the next field, which is how a guard turns into a formality
somebody edits on the way past -- the failure mode this docstring names. The
alternative on the table was to shorten an unrelated paper's prose by a line,
which buys the same room while hiding that the papers grew.

It moved again, 2,520 -> 2,730 (2026-09-10), and this is that review. The
change is a whole paper rather than a field: contracts/harness.py, 198 lines,
declaring the four strategy roles the agent loop delegates to (Memory,
Planning, Capability, Action) and the carriers between them. It is the one
addition the four-module seam needs -- the roles were carved out of code the
loop already ran, so no behaviour moves with them -- and no amount of trimming
fits it under the old number: the overage alone is 193 lines against a file of
198, which would leave four Protocol signatures and nothing saying why they
are the four.

The paper is the whole of it. Without it the package stands at 2,515, which is
five lines under the number it has been passing on, so nothing here is a
ceiling absorbing somebody else's growth.

Seventeen lines of headroom, and deliberately not more. The smallest paper in
the package is 37 lines, so the slack cannot absorb a second one: the next
paper trips this gate and lands in this docstring the way this one did, while
a field or a docstring line on an existing paper still fits without a review
nobody would learn anything from.

It moved again, 2,730 -> 2,791, and this is that review. Two additions, both
about a call the loop could not describe once it was over. A failed model call
had no shape anything could carry: the loop knew a provider had raised and the
record kept a turn that simply stopped, so a run read back afterwards could not
say which call failed or what the provider said. ``CallRecord`` is that shape,
50 lines, with the two fields on the provider paper that hand it over. The
second is a single field, ``first_byte_timeout`` on ``GenerationSettings``,
with the prose for why a stream that never started is not a stream that
stopped: 9 lines.

The count is 2,771, and the twenty above it is the same headroom this docstring
argued for the first time, not room set aside to spend.

2,791 -> 2,960 (2026-09-14): the memory seam grew two declared shapes.
``contracts/memory.py`` gained ``health()`` with ``HealthCheck`` / ``BackendHealth``
(what ``raven doctor`` and ``raven import`` read instead of the plugin's
internals), and ``contracts/onboard.py`` is a new paper (``OnboardUI`` /
``OnboardStep`` / ``StepOutcome``, the screen a memory plugin contributes to
``raven onboard``). Measured at 2,938 on top of the ``CallRecord`` round
above; the headroom is the same twenty-odd lines as above, for the same reason.

2,960 -> 2,990 (2026-09-15): two grants the seam round left implicit. A
memory backend gained ``delete()``, which the memory browser needs in order to
stop deleting a derived index row behind a source of truth that keeps the text;
and ``ServiceLocator`` gained the host's embedding block, so the knowledge base
and the memory backend read one endpoint rather than a copy each. Measured at
2,969; the headroom is the same twenty-odd lines, for the same reason.
