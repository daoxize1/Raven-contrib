 * priority rather than composed -- a component would be a root around a
 * single-child switch.
 *
 * Order is the whole design: a memory fault beats a missing capability,
 * because a backend that stopped storing has been handing back normal-looking
 * replies the whole time, while an unconfigured search has been visibly
 * refusing. Whichever wins draws alone.
